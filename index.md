## Definitions ##
The keywords MUST, MAY, and SHOULD are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119:

* MUST: This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", means that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
* MUST NOT: This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
* SHOULD: This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", means that there May exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications Must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
* SHOULD NOT: This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there May exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behaviour is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behaviour described with this label.
