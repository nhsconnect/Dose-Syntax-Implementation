{% include important.html content="The ITK3 Messaging Solution security described in this section is not meant to be complete but a starting point to understand some design considerations to consider when implementing ITK3 Messaging Solutions." %}

# Security within Test #

Security starts to be a key element of the design and process for testing at this point. The following four key principles should be considered:

- Authentication
- Authorisation
- Encryption
- Signatures

# Security examples #

The following non-exhaustive list describes common security patterns and links to example cases where they are used:

- Basic Auth
- OAuth2
- Certifications/SSL
- JWT - GP Connect
- OpenId
- NHS Verify (UK only)
- Citizen Id (UK only)
- SmartCards (UK only)

Depending on the chosen end usage, channel and network will influence the chosen security choice.
