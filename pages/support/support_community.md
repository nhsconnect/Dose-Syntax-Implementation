This group chat has been set up to support FHIR implementers internationally. It’s an active site with technical discussions and a good place to post questions about the FHIR standard. The site regularly has several new posts each hour and features regular contributions from FHIR standards experts such as Graham Grieve and and Brian Postlethwaite.

This is Graham Grieve’s blog and company website. Here he regularly posts FHIR related content which can be commented on (although it seems that this is rare). Given Graham’s involvement in the FHIR standard, this is an authoritative blog on the subject and an important blog to follow.
